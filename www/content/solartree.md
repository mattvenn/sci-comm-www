The Energy Tree in Bristol's central Millennium Square combines community collaboration, artistic excellence, science and grass-roots energy activism in a unique project.

The Energy Tree is a public art installation and renewable power source designed
to engage the public in energy issues.

## Personal notes

I worked with Demand Energy Equality and was responsible for building the hardware and software that fetches and displays the energy generated by the solar tree. Working with @Bristol science center to design the visualisation and hosting it on the cursive data website.

## Impact

Installed in Millenium square, the solar tree provides free wifi and phone charging. Users answer an energy quiz and can explore the energy animation.
