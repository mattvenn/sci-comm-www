Title: Aerial Photography
Category: STEM workshop
Date: 2014
Background: pics/aerialphotography/1.jpg

This workshop is designed to inspire the next generation of renewable energy engineers to use practical maths and science skills.

The 2 hour workshop is structured into fun and fast paced sections, from computer programming to calculating volume. Each section works towards sending a hydrogen-filled balloon into the air to take aerial photographs of participants.

## Personal notes

I designed, tested and trialled the workshop before training Arcola Energy facilitators to run the workshop as part of the EcoIsland project.

## Learning objectives

* Main components of a computer
* Sequences and Loops as fundamental concepts in programming
* Writing a simple program
* Computers can control cameras, be small and light
* Hydrogen is a way to get lift for a balloon
* Hydrogen is also a way to store energy
* Calculate how many balloons are required to lift the computer

## Impact

Initial running for 15 primary schools on the Isle of Wight as part of the
EcoIsland project, the workshop is still regularly run by Arcola Energy.
