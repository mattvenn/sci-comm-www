An exceptional learning experience - developed in collaboration with space industry leaders and robotics innovators - that will alters students’ perception of both space exploration and their own potential contribution to this sector.


Students will develop their skills in all four STEM disciplines – programming robot ‘rovers’  and deploying them  to carry out real missions and take samples in a search for signs of life as they map a replica Martian landscape.

## Personal notes

I worked with the @Bristol science center team to bid for ESA funding, design
and trial the missions, develop the mission control software, train the science
communicators and help to faciliate the pilot and first set of workshops during
British science week.

One of the aspects I enjoy when running workshops is when the participants
suprise me by pushing the boundaries of the workshop. An example of this was
when one group of students, frustrated by not knowing how many points their team
had contributed, used the website's API to download the samples, categorise them by team and then print a score table.

## Learning objectives

* Learn about the European Space Agency’s Aurora Mission and ExoMars rover programme
* Consider what the signs of extraterrestrial life might be and how to look for them
* In small teams (max 3) use Python computing language to programme a newly developed robot rover
* Programme a robot to perform tasks on the Martian landscape, including manoeuvring; taking photos; avoiding obstacles
* Programme robot to take reading of temperature, CH4, humidity and location and upload this information to a class map
* Work collaboratively  - sharing learning to jointly map the whole terrain and interpret data
* Recognise the many and varied roles that contribute to a successful mission of this sort
* Reflect on the opportunities that may be open to them in this and related STEM sectors

## Impact

A new workshop for @Bristol, so far over 200 children have taken part. The workshop will now become part of the set that @Bristol offer to local schools.
