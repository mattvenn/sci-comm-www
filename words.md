![pic](pics/earthtomars/1.jpg)

## Summary of project

An exceptional learning experience - developed in collaboration with space industry leaders and robotics innovators - that will alters students’ perception of both space exploration and their own potential contribution to this sector.

Students will develop their skills in all four STEM disciplines – programming robot ‘rovers’  and deploying them  to carry out real missions and take samples in a search for signs of life as they map a replica Martian landscape.

## Personal notes

I worked with the @Bristol science center team to bid for ESA funding, design
and trial the missions, develop the mission control software, train the science
communicators and help to faciliate the pilot and first set of workshops during
British science week.

One of the aspects I enjoy when running workshops is when the participants
suprise me by pushing the boundaries of the workshop. An example of this was
when one group of students, frustrated by not knowing how many points their team
had contributed, used the website's API to download the samples, categorise them by team and then print a score table.

## Learning objectives

* Learn about the European Space Agency’s Aurora Mission and ExoMars rover programme
* Consider what the signs of extraterrestrial life might be and how to look for them 
* In small teams (max 3) use Python computing language to programme a newly developed robot rover
* Programme a robot to perform tasks on the Martian landscape, including manoeuvring; taking photos; avoiding obstacles
* Programme robot to take reading of temperature, CH4, humidity and location and upload this information to a class map
* Work collaboratively  - sharing learning to jointly map the whole terrain and interpret data
* Recognise the many and varied roles that contribute to a successful mission of this sort
* Reflect on the opportunities that may be open to them in this and related STEM sectors

## Impact

A new workshop for @Bristol, so far over 200 children have taken part. The workshop will now become part of the set that @Bristol offer to local schools.

![pic](pics/aerialphotography/1.jpg)

## Summary of project

This workshop is designed to inspire the next generation of renewable energy engineers to use practical maths and science skills. The 2 hour workshop is structured into fun and fast paced sections, from computer programming to calculating volume. Each section works towards sending a hydrogen-filled balloon into the air to take aerial photographs of participants.

## Personal notes

I designed, tested and trialled the workshop before training Arcola Energy facilitators to run the workshop as part of the EcoIsland project.

## Learning objectives

* Main components of a computer
* Sequences and Loops as fundamental concepts in programming
* Writing a simple program
* Computers can control cameras, be small and light
* Hydrogen is a way to get lift for a balloon
* Hydrogen is also a way to store energy
* Calculate how many balloons are required to lift the computer

## Impact

Initial running for 15 primary schools on the Isle of Wight as part of the
EcoIsland project, the workshop is still regularly run by Arcola Energy.

TODO photos of spin paintings

## Summary of project

Children built solar powered moodlamps to take home, learning about electricity
and solar panels. Children learned to solder LEDs, and lamps were decorated with spin paintings.

## Personal notes

I co-designed and co-facilitated this workshop for the Abu Dhabi science festival. 

The main challenge of this workshop was to come up with something that was cheap
enough to give away, but still provide an engaging learning experience. We
co-opted solar garden lights as a way of cheaply getting the battery, solar
panel and LED. 

We also came up with the idea of using a bicycle wheel to facilitate easy and
beautiful shades for the lamps.

## Learning objectives

* What is a solar panel and how does it work?
* How can we store the power from the sun to use at night?
* What is electricity, and how does it do useful work?
* What is an LED, how does it work?

## Impact

2000 children took part in the workshop in October 2013.

Matthew produced and facilitated an interactive 45 minute workshop for Abu Dhabi
Science Festival. The festival requires content providers to work to tight
deadlines and to respond to different briefs and requirements each year. The
festival is very large, welcoming over 150,000 visitors annually and consequently workshops can be very busy. Mathew’s innovative workshops worked very well in
this environment and were always popular and well received by visitors.
Participating in the event requires great team-working skills and flexibility.
Mathew was required to deliver training to his teams of local science
communicators and then mentor them throughout the event to deliver in both
English and Arabic. He was able to do so with skill and confidence. We have no
hesitation in recommending him and his team for any science communication event.

# Hydrogen Challenge / STEM workshop / 2012 - 2016

![pic](pics/hydrogenchallenge/1.jpg)

## Summary of project

This workshop uses hydrogen to fuel a Lego car which participants will design
and build. The cars that each team builds will have a race of efficiency – the
car which travels the furthest on a fixed amount of fuel will win! Participants
will be encouraged to build their models as quickly as possible, then race their
cars a number of times in a process of iterative design.  Each time, they can go
back and make changes to their car in order to try and improve their distance.
At the end of the session, each team keeps their highest score.

## Personal notes

I was responsible for designing the workshop and trialling it. During the trial we decided to move away from custom made laser cut 'mechano' and use Lego for a faster workshop shutdown and turnaround. Following a successfull run at the Abu Dhabi science festival I trained Arcola Energy facilitators to continue running the workshop.

One of the parts I enjoyed about running this workshop was getting the
opportunity to run it so much at the science festivals. By the end of the first
week we had mastered the delivery of it, and it was a great experience to be
performing it so well.

## Learning objectives

* Hydrogen can be used as a fuel and to store energy
* Understanding the process of storing energy
* Practising iterative design – working quickly, failing fast
* Team work and co-operation
* Sources of energy for the future
* Understanding what is meant by efficiency
* Understanding why we make changes to designs

## Impact

Arcola educators and engineers have delivered workshops to over 1,500 London
school students as part of the London Schools Hydrogen Challenge, 3,000 Abu
Dhabi school students at the Abu Dhabi Science Festival and 800 students at the
Cambridge Phyisics at Work programme. In June 2015 Arcola delivered workshops to
1000 students on the Isle of Wight as part of the Island Hydrogen Project.

# Science of Snow / Exhibit / 2010

![pic](pics/scienceofsnow/1.png)

## Summary of project

Science of Snow is an interactive exhibit that starts by illustrating how snowflakes form and ends with a unique snowflake postcard to take away.

By controlling environmental conditions, participants grow a unique snowflake; its shape is a visual history of the journey from cloud to ground.

## Personal notes

I researched, designed and built the software and hardware for the exhibit. I
learnt a lot about the science of snow, and enjoyed working through a paper
on modelling snowflake formation by Janko Gravner, David Griffeath and Clifford A. Reiter. 

Working with Lou Smith (carpentry) and the London Hackspace (laser cutting) gave me lots of opportunities to work on my fabrication skills.

## Impact

The exhibit has been shown at many galleries including The Crypt (London) Motorcycle showroom and Lakota (Bristol). Over 3000 postcards were printed and taken by participants.

# Wind Turbine / STEM workshop / 2010 - 2013

![pic](pics/windturbine/1.jpg)

## Summary of project

The wind turbine project challenges groups of children to build the most effective wind turbines from recycled plastic bottles. A league table allows groups to test different designs and test which is the most effective.

## Personal notes

I designed and co-built the tunnel and control software. I was then responsible for running the workshop at the SAUCE events held at London Metropolitan University.

This workshop is always great to run, the concept is so simple the children can
get straight into the cycle of making, testing and improving. I think it's
important children get to experience hands on engineering in a space where
creativity is encouraged and mistakes are acceptable.

## Impact

3 years of SAUCE workshops with 1500 children taking part over 4 weeks. Over 20 school workshops run
